This error typically occurs when you're using a feature of Expo that relies on native modules (like camera, location, etc.) and those modules aren't properly configured or linked in your project.  It could also stem from incorrect configuration of your development environment or dependencies. The exact cause depends on what you're trying to do in your Expo app.  Here's an example of what might cause the error when using the Camera API:

```javascript
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';

// ... later in your component...

const takePicture = async () => {
  const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
  if (status === 'granted') {
    // Take a picture
  } else {
    Alert.alert('Camera permission not granted.');
  }
};
```

If you haven't properly handled permission requests or have other issues within your Expo app that involve interacting with native features, you might encounter `Unhandled promise rejection` or other similar errors related to Expo modules.
